Computer science is a rather young discipline, though computing and coded communication have been around for thousands of years. Sumerian abacus, Blaise Pascal’s calculator, Morse code, Braille code, modern computers, smartphones, and artificial intelligence are all important parts of it.

If you’re a developer or programmer looking to sharpen your skills in a particular programming language or a computer science student keen on exploring the history of computing, there are many great books that can help you advance your knowledge and career.

What You Should Look for in a Computer Science Book
When shopping for a computer science book, you should pay close attention to the following 3 criteria – the author’s background and authority, specific skills taught in the book, and the audience level. Let’s take a closer look at each.

Author Background and Authority
First, you should check out the writer of the book you are considering. Check their reputation in the computer science world and whether they’re a true authority on the subject they’re writing about.

You should also investigate whether they’ve worked with large tech corporations or have a background in teaching at MIT or other prestigious universities.

Specific Skill
Next, you should check if the book you intend to buy teaches specific skills you want to incorporate into your arsenal. Let’s say that you want to learn how to build machine learning systems.

In that case, a book on the history of computing and code probably won’t be the best fit. Likewise, if you’re interested in making Android and iOS apps, there’s not much you can learn from a book on Python.

Audience Level
Finally, you should take the current level of your knowledge and skills into consideration. If you’re just starting out, a book written with beginners in mind would be the best match.

If you’re an experienced pro, look for books that cover in-depth concepts and advanced features of the language you program in.

7. The Self-Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff
Who’s it for? Beginners
Price: On sale
Cory Althoff, the author of The Self-Taught Programmer, learned to code by himself. He landed a gig at eBay after a year of learning to code in Python 3. However, he was overwhelmed by how much he didn’t know and how poorly prepared he was for the challenges at work.

Several years later, his experience with eBay prompted Althoff to put together The Self-Taught Programmer, an all-in-one guide for all beginners who are serious about becoming professional programmers. Aside from coding, Althoff also teaches other skills needed to land and keep a job in a high-profile tech company.
